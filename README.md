# Pedestrains-detection

Pedestrian detection is a critical component in modern computer vision applications, particularly in the fields of autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance systems. One effective method for pedestrian detection is the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), which excels in extracting features from images by capturing gradient orientations and magnitudes. HOG works by dividing an image into small, spatially connected cells, computing histograms of gradient orientations within each cell, and then normalizing these histograms over larger blocks. This feature descriptor, combined with a classifier, can detect and localize pedestrians with high accuracy. Python's scikit-image library provides a convenient implementation of HOG, making it accessible for developers and researchers to apply this technique for pedestrian detection tasks. By leveraging HOG's ability to describe local gradient patterns, applications can achieve robust and efficient pedestrian detection, crucial for enhancing safety and functionality in various automated systems.
